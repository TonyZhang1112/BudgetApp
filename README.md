# My Personal Project

## Budget Maker/Manager

For my personal CPSC 210 project, I will be making an application that allows the user to create (multiple) budgets, and will **organize them and keep track of earnings and spendings**. It will also suggest amounts to save, and should alert when spending gets close to, or over, the user's income. This project is of interest to me because it would allow me to create something I could use (and personalize) for myself in the future.

This application will be useful for:
- Those who need to manage multiple spending budgets (Ex. Accountants)
- Those who have trouble balancing their own budget
- Those who have many income and expenses to manage
